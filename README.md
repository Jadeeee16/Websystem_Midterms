<h1>Final Reflection</h1>
<p>
    Like the players of <i>Alice in Borderland</i>, we stepped into unfamiliar territory, faced challenges head-on, and pushed through the unknown. Building this website wasn’t easy—it tested our patience, creativity, and determination. But in the end, just like survivors in the Borderland, we made it. We hope this website captures that same spirit: of playing the game, taking risks, and finding meaning in the journey.
